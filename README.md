# Bayesian-ML-PhD-Prep

This repository documents my preparation process for applying to PhD programs in probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian inference. My goal is to strengthen my understanding in:

- Foundational probability and statistics
- Bayesian modeling and reasoning
- Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)
- Practical implementation using Python and PyMC

I will be updating this repo weekly with notes, exercises, and mini-projects from selected courses and tutorials.  
ðŸŽ¯ Target: Submit PhD applications by October 2025.
