# Week 1: Probability Basics

This document summarizes the key concepts and takeaways from the first week of probability review (based on Khan Academy and/or MIT OCW materials).

---

## 🔢 Topics Covered

- What is probability?
- Random events and outcomes
- Sample space, events, and probability rules
- Conditional probability
- Bayes' Theorem (brief intro)
- Expected value and variance

---

## 📝 Notes & Examples

> Example: What is the probability of rolling an even number on a fair 6-sided die?

\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
\]

> Conditional Probability:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]
