# Week 1: Probability Basics

ðŸ“˜ Based on Khan Academy "Statistics and Probability" â€“ Chapters 1â€“3  
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Review fundamental probability concepts to support Bayesian reasoning

---

## âœ… Summary

I completed all three units of Khan Academyâ€™s probability section, which covered:

- Basic probability concepts and rules
- Conditional probability and independence
- Random variables, probability distributions, expected value, and variance

These concepts were already familiar to me, but this quick review helped reinforce the mental models Iâ€™ll need for Bayesian inference.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

### Probability & Events

- Probability values range from 0 to 1  
- Probability of an event = favorable outcomes / total outcomes  
- Complement rule:  
  \[
  P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(A)
  \]

### Conditional Probability

- Formula:  
  \[
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
  \]
- Useful for updating beliefs when new information is available

### Independence

- Events A and B are independent if:  
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  \]

### Expected Value & Variance

- Expected value (mean):  
  \[
  E[X] = \sum x_i \cdot P(x_i)
  \]
- Variance:  
  \[
  \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2]
  \]

## ðŸ§  Personal Notes

- These concepts were covered in my earlier academic training.
- I feel confident with the calculations and interpretations.
- Ready to move forward into Bayesian thinking in Week 2.
