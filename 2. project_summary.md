# PhD Project Summary: Bayesian Machine Learning Preparation

## 🎯 Motivation

I aim to apply for PhD programs focusing on probabilistic modeling and Bayesian reasoning. My goal is to work on AI systems that reason under uncertainty and interact intelligently with humans.

## 🧠 Key Areas of Interest

- Bayesian inference and learning
- Probabilistic graphical models
- Human-AI collaboration with uncertainty modeling
- Approximate inference and variational methods

## 🧪 What I've Done

- Completed [Bayesian Statistics – Coursera]
- Reviewed probability theory (Khan Academy + MIT 18.05)
- Built small Bayesian models in PyMC3
- Started a GitHub repo to track learning and share progress

## 📝 Next Steps

- Contact potential supervisors (starting mid-Sept)
- Submit applications by Oct 2025
- Continue learning PGM and advanced inference methods
