# Week 2: Bayesian Thinking – Priors, Likelihood, Posterior

This document summarizes key concepts from Week 2 of the Bayesian Statistics course on Coursera (UCSC). It covers the basic building blocks of Bayesian inference.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- Prior distribution
- Likelihood function
- Bayes’ Theorem in action
- Posterior distribution
- Beta and Bernoulli conjugate priors

---

## ✍️ Notes

> Posterior ∝ Likelihood × Prior  
> \[
P(\theta \mid x) \propto P(x \mid \theta) \cdot P(\theta)
\]

## 💡 Reflections

- How do different priors affect the posterior?
- What happens with more data?
- What applications might benefit from Bayesian thinking?
